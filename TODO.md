# To do

- [x] API auth. Must fix admin problem. Create seed user and disable signups.

- [x] Mint some NFTs and add them to the API.

- [X] Run test with placeholder tuner.sh script.
- [X] Write and test the tuner. Start with the recorder.
- [X] And then the joiner.
- [ ] Make placeholder image and espeak recording for unsold nfts. Use placeholder ipfss as initial image and audio, before sold.
